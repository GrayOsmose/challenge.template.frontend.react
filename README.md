# Simple template for fast test projects creation

## Description

This template was created for fast challenges compleation which are comming from different companies.

## Components used

It's based on react with redux state management.

### UI

As ui framework was chosen [antd](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design). It has wonderful documentation and I had no problem in using it.

### Routing

Just as an example it has simple routing with parameter. There won't be any issue in implementing custom routes.


## ToDo

- Tests
- Problems with `linter`.
